I just have to prove to you I can be better.” Lorn chuckles as you walk up his porch steps, “Hello there! Won’t you join us for dinner? The supplies can all be stocked later tonight.” As Lorn stands, he seems older, more frail than you remember. Maybe it’s a trick of the evening light, you think to yourself. At dinnertime, you all enjoy a well prepared meal out of some of the ingredients you brought, and some strange fish you don’t recognize. Thomas and Lorn again begin to talk spiritedly. Lorn’s eyes positively gleam the entire time, returning the youthful countenance you view in him, despite his advancing age. “You just gotta let me prove to you that I’ve gotten better! Our friend here has seen it firsthand! Look at the haul we’ve made at Pirate’s Cove! I was a part of that, you know…” Before Thomas continues, you notice a slight hitch in Thomas’s arm as he winces, spearing a piece of fish. “What is this fish anyways?” “It’s extremely rare. In fact, no one I know could find or identify it, but the trader called it a Glassback, it’s not native to our oceans or lakes, so I’ve no idea how they came across it, but I paid a pretty penny for the privilege. I bought it a few months ago but never had the right time to share it, but now seems as good as any, eh?” You mention how good the fish is, and Thomas agrees.

You take a sip of tea, knowing that good things come to those who wait. “Before Thomas wears a hole in my porch, let me tell you what I know…” Thomas stares at Lorn with rapt attention. “In the days before, legend tells us the guardians of the world were sent forth to oversee the land, to give it a final shape and form. To walk amongst the people and care for them as one might care for a flock. Among them was Zho, though you might know them as Zholice or perhaps Shva, their ancient name is written in books I have read. Zho was the guardian of water and sapphire and they made their home among the people. There are legends of an unending cold known as Shva’s Playground, and within it lies Zho’s Lake. The lake is as clear as day, and it’s said you can walk on the lake and ice will form under your feet as you walk.” Lorn guffaws, “Fairy tales, I tell you…” After another pause, he continues “Other legends say that there is but one stream that leaves the lake, and that is how a fish from that mythical place could be found in the ocean. These fish are so rare, their value would be greater than anything you’ve seen so far. I didn’t believe it myself until I discovered the one from tonight a few months back.” Thomas, leaning over the balcony, looks back to you both. “I’m gonna find that Lake, and I’m gonna fish up the best fish you’ve ever had Lorn, on my honor!” He looks to you and says, “Pack your things, we’re going north!” As he strides away, Lorn carries a wistful but knowing smile as he turns back to his house. “But I haven’t finished my story…” You wonder if Lorn hadn’t planned this all along, but in the meantime, you realize you need to prepare for a trek to the north. `,

Lorn looks to you, “He seems to have taken a nasty spill. I noticed him acting oddly lately, but didn’t expect anything like this.

    info:`The trek north is slow but steady progress. The carts carrying your snow machines are well prepared thanks to the weight balancing steel plates and large tyres with treads Jill added. They also work off a strange system of wheel propulsion you nor Thomas understand, but they lighten your trek significantly and make obstructions significantly easier to navigate. A week of traveling, past Cane Pole Ridge and farther north, you’re surprised to find rolling hills that never seem to break into a flatland or a mountain range. On the break of the ninth day, you see in the distance a bright gleam of sun, dazzling your eyes, you realize this might be the direction you seek. You change tack to the northwest and the temperature begins to drop precipitously. Ice begins to take over the landscape, and yet to the east and west, you see nothing but clear skies and green fields. “This feels right,” Thomas says excitedly, “We’re gonna find this place and I’m gonna be the greatest fisherman slash explorer in Redbrook!” You both make camp for the night and prepare for a journey into frozen lands in the morning. Thomas seems somehow brighter through this experience, and you haven’t noticed any of the odd ticks from the previous days. Maybe Lorn was right, you think to yourself. You both spend the better part of the morning trying to figure out exactly how Jill got these contraptions *on* the cart to begin with. While looking over the machines more thoroughly, you spy a big red button labeled “Start”. Exhausted, you hop on and when you press the start button, the snow machine comes whirring to life. Gears begin turning and before you know it the treads on the backs of the machine start spinning slowly and you begin inching forward. Thomas laughs triumphantly and yells, “It’s working! It’s working! Well, at least I think that’s what Jill might say.” After a moment of revelry, you press the button again and the machine abruptly stops. You notice at that point a letter from Jill taped to the side of the machine with specific unloading instructions as well as operating instructions. “Friends, Here are my new creations, schematics I had only dreamed of until I heard of the parts you’d found in the Jundland Wastes – please take care of them, I’d be ever so sad never to see them again. Your friend, Jill (not a farmer)”`,

    info:`After half an hour, you both feel comfortable enough with the machinery to start traveling with it, so you set off. The machines are not very noisy, but the occasional clang and ping is quite jarring in the quiet intensity of the growing cold and snow as you travel further north. For each minute that passes, you grow more and more unsettled. Distinctly to the east and west you can still see green. The area slowly grows more forested in all directions but only in the small swathe of land you travel is there snow as it slopes gently upwards. Slowly over the next hour the snow-covered land expands on both sides, greenery becoming overtaken by white, making you believe you started near the point of this mysterious phenomenon. Thomas seems determined to trek onward, and his determination is met suddenly by a fierce blowing wind. Snow begins falling from the sky at a rapid pace, though no clouds appear overhead. The effect of wind, snow, and bright sun are disorienting, the light glinting off the snow crystals creating beautiful fleeting patterns of reflected light all around you. You both lean forward, almost willing your machines to traverse the snow faster as the winds intensify until suddenly, you reach a barrier of snow, ice, and wind. “It’s too dangerous!” you shout to Thomas. The roaring maelstrom in front of you fills you with terror and a hint of sorrow. “We must go back!” Thomas looks to you, a mad gleam in his eye, “No!” You try to call out again, but Thomas lurches forward. His machine begins to enter the maelstrom and as he enters you hear an unearthly roar from all around you as Thomas and the snow contraption are both lifted into the air. Ice covers the machine and Thomas is thrown viciously backwards. He crumples to the ground unnaturally and the storm subsides as you run towards Thomas. `,

It seems slow, almost imperceptible, but after a quick check he is breathing. You pick up Thomas as gingerly as possible, the cold seems to emanate from his body, penetrating all the layers of covering you’re wearing. Gingerly, you put Thomas in front of you on the snow machine and rush back the way you came. Lorn will know what to do, the thought crosses your mind. You return to the edge of the phenomenon and quickly fashion a makeshift cart for Thomas. Jill's going to be very mad at me as well, you think to yourself as you leave the snow machine behind. You grab the cart, make sure Thomas is safe, and rush back to Redbrook. The trip takes less time, as you skip breaks, traveling on minimal sleep, you travel recklessly to get back sooner. Each time you check on Thomas, you see the frost has crawled farther up his arms and legs. Exhausted, you reach Redbrook after seven days of hard, almost ceaseless travel and caring for Thomas the best you can, you find yourself collapsing on Lorn’s doorstep. Lorn opens his door as you weakly gesture towards the cart and even though you are pointing towards the cart, you don’t understand why Lorn is trying to help you to a chair. “You fools. You bloody fools!” The words come from Lorn's mouth, but you hear Star Meerif's voice. `,

    info:`Each day during this week, you have checked on Thomas and his health has returned much more quickly than you or Lorn have anticipated. Lorn has spent much time researching the effects of the item Star requested for healing, but he seems to refuse to want to ask for more information, content to find old parchments in his basement and mutter to himself from beside Thomas’ bed. Thomas on the other hand has been pressing Lorn for as much information on Shva and Shva’s Wall. On one occasion, Lorn let slip that Star or Cecil might know more about it. After two weeks, despite both you and Lorn’s protests to the contrary, Thomas’ inquiries into Shva’s Wall have only grown more persistent and with begrudging consent from Lorn, and Thomas’ insistence that he would pursue this with or without you, you’ve found yourself joining Thomas on a trip to Cecil’s manor. Before the third knock, the door opens, and Cecil appears before you both. His clothes are different from what you remember, more like robes than his typical business attire and he seems quite irate. “What do you want? I’m very busy.” Thomas shuffles his feet, clearly not expecting this rough welcome. He mumbles through a greeting before clearly stating, “I want to get through Shva’s Wall.” Cecil was clearly not expecting this forward statement from Thomas and his face breaks out into a broad smile. “My dear fellow, why didn’t you say that sooner? Come in, come in.” You step inside Cecil's home. Somehow, the opulence of his home continues to amaze you, the large hall, filled with baubles, gems and other devices always takes your breath away. You recall the room you visited with the energy core, but Cecil instead takes you to his dining room, where three sets of cups, a tea kettle, milk, and sugar are in the middle of the table. Before you can ask how Cecil had these ready, he begins speaking as you sit down. “I heard rumors that hooligan Star wouldn’t help you out, so I’ve been doing a little research of my own and found I might already have something to help you with your journey, if you’re willing to pay the price.” Thomas looks intensely at Cecil, “I’ll pay any price.” Cecil looks to you both, “Great, let’s have some tea and discuss the…tea.” Cecil laughs to himself, but you don’t quite understand why. `,

As the years went on, Zho shared what they learned of Power with others, and the Playground eventually grew into a temple. Zho explored the world, and many knew of their name, until one day Zho returned to their Playground, only to find their temple destroyed and their followers murdered. It was at that moment Zho’s Wall was born, Zho poured their sorrow and pain into this Wall, and then disappeared.” Cecil pauses for a moment before pulling a plain case out from underneath his robes. The case has writing on it you don’t recognize and a golden leaf adorns the latch. Considering the splendor of Cecil’s home, the box seems positively ordinary in comparison. “We know this story thanks to ancient wizards of the Golden Leaf who traveled to the Playground – few survived, but this – this is the only relic we have from that time.” Cecil opens the case and before you can see what’s inside, a powerful shock wave unlike anything you’ve ever experienced hits you. The sound of the ocean, the roar of the wind, the frigidness of snow, and the scalding heat of boiling water overwhelms your senses. You fall off your chair and see Thomas sitting, staring rapturously at the box. Cecil abruptly closes the box and the sensation is immediately gone. “I should have warned you, this is an item of immense Power. I call it Zho’s Dagger, and it most certainly is the item that killed Zho.” A quietness covers the room as the enormity of Cecil’s words wash over you. “I gather now, you understand the enormity of what I am about to suggest. I want you to revisit Zho’s Playground, bring this dagger with you and use its power to counteract the Power of Zho’s Wall and go inside and understand what happened, and bring me back something.” Thomas blinks, “And fish.” Cecil smiles, “Yes, and fish.” Thomas looks at you and without hesitation blurts out, “We’ll do it! What do you want in return?” Cecil shakes his head and looks away for a moment, “A safer world for us all, and some information I’ve long pondered. Consider this journey the favor I ask of you…and maybe a few rare things I’ve misplaced. But mostly the first thing.” Cecil hands the box to Thomas. “Keep it secret, keep it safe, and when you approach the wall open the box and hold onto that dagger with all your will. Now, I have important things to be doing.” Cecil looks expectantly at you both and you get the impression it’s your time to leave. `,

Either speak plainly, or kindly stop speaking at all.” Star looks to Lorn for a moment, and you can see his internal struggle before he smooths his robes and takes a deep breath. “There are powers in this world even I do not dare trifle with, but if I cannot convince you to change your mind, I shall share with you the only helpful legend I know regarding Zho. His followers were known to be extraordinarily kind, and when in his domain you had but to ‘speak the ancient word for friend’. What happens beyond that is something only the gods know now.” Star pauses for a moment before practically pleading with you. “Consider once last time staying home and safe - ignore this fools errand.” You shake your head, intent on ensuring Thomas’ safety. Star looks quietly to Lorn and disappears in a cloud of feathers but words echo, “Friendship. More enriches life, less offers nothing.” Lorn looks quietly to you, “Whatever ails Thomas, he seems inextricably bound in all this, in ways I don’t understand and no one will explain to me, for better or worse. I…don’t want either of you to go. I’m a fool - I believed Thomas having a goal would help heal him, instead I’ve put you both in terrible, terrible danger.” Lorn pauses a moment, and a single tear runs down his left cheek. “Even now, I realize I’m not too old to have new regrets, new follies. Be safe. Bring my friend back safely.” Lorn lingers a moment longer, seemingly wanting to say more but he turns slowly and steps out of the house and you are left alone, feeling as though you’re on the precipice of something bigger than you understand. `,

info:`You awake to the sound of a terrible rumble coming from town. It gently rattles the glass on your nightstand. Outside your bedroom window, the night sky suddenly becomes bright orange and then dims back to normal pale moonlight. You slowly get out of bed and reluctantly make your way to the window. A large and very black column of smoke is rising slowly from somewhere in Redbrook. You consider going back to bed, but eventually curiosity gets the better of you. After quickly dressing, you make your way to town. Near the northern edge of town, a hundred meters behind a few small houses, you find the town fire squad working hard to extinguish a bright and narrow, but furious blaze. You’re surprised at how little damage there is given how loud and bright the explosion was from your farm. It appears there was a small structure here that is nearly obliterated, and a black ring extends out in all directions, around 10 meters from the center of the fire. As you look around, you see a shadowy figure concealed behind a tree to the north of the blaze. The shadowy person appears to be robed, but has a very familiar, clumpy shape to their silhouette. As you continue to look at the shadow, it extends a hand and beckons to you. Before you can decide whether to go to the summoning shadow, a member of the fire squad calls out to you that the fire isn’t going out and that they think they’re going to need something stronger. Will you find something stronger than water to help extinguish the fire? Buddy Friendship 50`,

info:`The town fire squad quickly puts the items you've brought back to good use. Relief crosses their faces one by one as the raging inferno is pushed back and eventually contained to a small area. As the bright orange blaze diminishes, you find yourself remembering a small and insignificant structure in this area, it was never unkempt, but never looked occupied either. Closing your eyes, you remember seeing a symbol on the door handle, but always thought it was just the mark of a tradesman. After of moment of reverie, you turn your attention back to the north of the fire to see the same clumpy robed figure. You can see two eyes, and they again extend their hand and beckon you to join them. Deciding to figure out who and what this person could want, you begin to head north when one of the fire squad cries out, "WATCH OUT, A SECONDARY EXPLOSION!" The entire fire squad dive on the ground and frozen by indecision, you stand as you feel the ground begin to rumble. The figure by the tree moves quicker than you expect, and you're knocked to the ground by none other than Buddy just as a sound and force, similar to what woke you up, wash over you. Ears ringing, you look over to see Buddy laying on the ground, seemingly unharmed as the fire squad are now fighting a reignited blaze and while you can't hear what they're saying, they seem to be motioning towards you for more materials like what you've provided previously, and you can't help but feel grateful towards Buddy and quickly go to gather more materials to help them out.

To your relief, and that of everyone working to put out the blaze, no more large explosions erupt, although several seemingly small ones crackle and pop underground. While the fire squad is still finishing up their efforts to put out small grass fires that popped up, Buddy grabs your shoulder and points you to the tree he was hiding behind earlier. You understand he wants you to join him away from the excitement, and the two of you quickly and quietly jog to the backside of the tree. Buddy squats down and you follow his example. Closer now to his massive visage, you notice that there are symbols painted on his face, although they’re hard to fully make out in the pale moonlight. One of the symbols reminds you of the symbol on the door handle you remembered earlier. Before you can ask about it, Buddy whispers. “Sorry about the ruckus tonight. That wasn’t supposed to happen. I’m glad no one was hurt. I know you have oh so many questions, but I think you should go home and get some rest and meet me back here in the morning. We have a lot of work to do.” You do, in fact have a lot of questions, but you decide to hold your peace until the morning. As you stand up to leave, Buddy whispers a request. He wants you to bring a bundle of inferno spheres tomorrow to help eliminate any unexploded devices still remaining in the meeting room. Now you really do have so many questions, but exhaustion finally saturates your brain and you decide sleep is your only real concern. You wish Buddy a good night, as well as the fire squad heroes as you pass them on your way home. Buddy Friendship 50`,

info:`Sunlight streams through your window, cascading off of the various trinkets in your bedroom in a dazzling display of color. You quickly regret not closing your blinds last night until a thought bolts you upright - you overslept! Your farm has plenty of morning chores to catch up on, and in the back of your mind, the request from Buddy about explosives, and the strange symbols keep you from focusing fully on the tasks at hand. Your animals seem to take offense to your half-hearted attention as you think about what Buddy could possibly have been doing with such destructive power - and why he had it in the first place. Chores completed, you realize Buddy never gave you instructions on where to meet him, so you make the assumption to head to the site of the explosion last night and hope to find him there. The area has been largely cordoned off. A few fire squad members wave to you half in exhaustion as you walk by. The area has been decimated and it's a miracle no one was hurt. There is smoke rising from the center of the explosion still, and ash has settled upon the area, a few pieces of misshapen paper and other material strewn about. You think you see a piece of paper with a caricature of a certain friend, but you can't be sure. As you approach, you notice the tree that Buddy spoke to you behind on the previous night is completely gone. It must have burned up in one of the secondary fires, you think to yourself. You look around a little more and notice another 50 meters further there is another innocuous building and a shadow that beckons you closer. Time for some answers! "Well, thanks for the spheres matey, but after a quick consultation this morning, I've realized I'm going to need to build some containment units in case we need a more...controlled explosion." You consider the implication of those words and decide to double the requested materials Buddy needs. Buddy Friendship 50`,

info:`When you return with the additional supplies, Buddy is waiting for you by the small building where he met you earlier. He invites you to follow him around to the entrance of the building and to bring the items you gathered. At the door, he pauses and explains his plan. He begins with little background, as though you already know what’s about to happen. “We’ll use this service entrance to access the main corridor. Once we reach the common area, I’ll pick up any unexploded devices and bring them to you. You’ll be waiting with the containment apparatus opened. Then, I’ll put the explosive in the container. You’ll move to the safety of the corridor, and I’ll place the inferno sphere in with the explosive and seal the container. I will then quickly move to the corridor with you.” “When the timer goes off, I’ll check to make sure the explosive was successfully transferred to the lava pools of the Ember Lagoon. If everything goes well, we should have the common area cleared of unexploded devices within an hour.” Without waiting for your response to this dangerous plan, Buddy opens the door and leads you into a small empty room lit by two glowing lanterns. At the far end of the room another door stands open and a series of steps lead downward. Buddy continues on to the stairs and begins to descend toward the corridor he mentioned. The stairs are well lit by a series of lanterns, but when you reach the bottom of the stairs and the entrance to the corridor, it is black and void. Buddy pauses at the corridor’s entrance and then turns back to you. “This is too dangerous to do in the dark. We really need a lot of lights. Will you get us some lanterns and candles and bring them down here? I’ll take a lantern from the stairs and scout out the situation ahead.” Buddy Friendship 50`,

As you bring more lighting in the room, the damage to the room seems to be immense. You're surprised the entire room hasn't collapsed where the explosion created a gaping hole that is covered in dirt and stone. The room is lavishly decorated, more reminiscent of something out of a novel than anything you expected. Extremely fancy chairs, tables, and chests are arrayed across the common room, the walls are draped in fine purple silks and murals and paintings of various people you don't recognize, except one - a picture of Buddy is displayed prominently near the edge of the room, close to the cave in. Before you can ask more questions, Buddy quickly begins shuffling small conical devices towards the container and wordlessly motions you towards the corridor as he sees you surveying the room. The process takes an hour, but Buddy for all his bluster, seems very adept at this process. Each device goes in the box, followed by a sphere, and a small popping sound follows as the timer hits zero. A little smoke wafts out of the box, and he moves onto the next. The process is impressively efficient. Buddy finally takes a seat on a chair after the process is over, sweat on his brow. It looks like he could use some refreshments. As you mention it Buddy gives you a big smile, "Yeah, the crew will need a lot to dig this mess back out, bring some extra!" The crew? Buddy Friendship 50`,

What is this place? Is Buddy a secret king or the leader of some revolutionary movement? Why were there so many unexploded explosives? What happened to set some of the explosives off last night? Buddy greets you at the entrance to the common area and interrupts your train of thought to thank you for all the help, and, as if he heard your pondered questions aloud, promises to explain everything very soon. For now, he asks you if you are ready to meet the crew. With your assent, Buddy whisks you into the common area and a waiting crowd. Before Buddy begins to introduce you to the crew, he steps on top of a wooden crate on the floor. “Friends! This is my very dear friend, {player}!” Buddy pauses for the crowd to all voice a greeting, and then continues. “{player} helped extinguish the fire from last night’s special activity preparations, and then helped me dispose of the other explosives this morning. Now, my dear friend brought us refreshments and tools to begin the great work that lies ahead of us. Please extend your gratitude and a hand of friendship to my friend and a friend to our...organization.” Barely a breath after finishing his address, Buddy hops off the crate and shepherds you to the waiting crowd. As he introduces you to each member, including many you already know, Buddy distributes the refreshments you brought. Even though the crowd is fairly large, around a hundred people at least, Buddy moves you through the entire group in a matter of minutes. Then, Buddy sits down on the burnt and scarred floor for a quick bite himself. He motions for you to join him as he begins eating. Buddy pauses between bites and seems to think for a few moments before continuing. Despite his pauses, Buddy finishes eating before you and everyone else. As you continue to enjoy the refreshments, Buddy begins to speak. “I know I’ve asked a lot of you already, but would you be willing to help us out with restoring the common area to its pre-explosion greatness? While the rest of us are removing all the debris and cleaning everything up, we could really use your help to replace the damaged furniture and some of the artifacts. I promise that after we have finished this project, I will answer all of your questions.” Buddy gives you a moment to consider, and then flourishes a list as soon as you agree. Buddy Friendship 50`,

info:`With the supplies you brought, the members of Buddy’s organization quickly begin rebuilding what looks like a small house, but is actually a shell for the entryway to the hall below. They even restore the door handle with the strange marking you remembered from the building’s previous incarnation. Since your part in the restoration is completed, Buddy sends you home with the promise that he will visit you in three days with more information and to collect your membership dues. “Don’t forget to have your dues ready and fully counted when I arrive, friend!” Three days later, exactly to the minute, Buddy arrives at your farm carrying a large box. You invite him in, and he quickly follows you and takes a seat, still holding the box. “Hullo, friend! I have all of your membership items here. I hope you enjoy them! We will have your induction ceremony tomorrow evening, assuming you have your dues ready for me now. If not, there may be some trouble, but I’m sure we won’t have to worry about that.” Buddy places the box on the floor and invites you to verify its contents before going to get your dues. Inside the box, you find a green cloak, a blue coin purse filled with dice, a stack of cards, a journal, some horseshoes, an hourglass, and three pencils. Seeing these items together a possibility slips into place in your mind and you ask Buddy if his organization is a gaming group. “Of course it is, silly! I figured you knew that from our emblem. The explosions the other night weren’t from our normal games though. We were trying to set up a game of ‘Keep Talking and Nothing Explodes’. Unfortunately, the explosive devices were a little too explosive in our testing.`,

Most of the time our games are much safer and mainstream, but Jenkins was in charge this time and he’s a bit…eccentric.” This information sets your mind at ease, but now you’re curious about the secrecy of this group. You ask Buddy and he smiles and explains. “The secrecy is just for fun, plus it’s part of our name. We’re the Secret Gaming Society of Redbrook! Well, you are too now! Ha! Speaking of which, do you have your dues?” Buddy Friendship 50 Previous Secretly A Society Summons You VIII",

Before you can knock, the door swings open and a member sweeps you inside, chiding you for your lack of discretion in the process. The entrance hall is now well lit and lavishly decorated. As you descend the stairs, you can hear faint sounds echoing ahead of you. Glass clinking against glass, shouts of exclamation, and other tidbits of sound you can't place rise in a cacophony of chaos ahead of you. As you arrive in the common room, Buddy is seated in a chair, holding rectangular cards with strange drawings on them yelling at a townsfolk across from him that you don't recognize. "YOU CAN'T RESOLVE MANA TAP AFTER THE REKEEP STEP! THAT'S A CLEAR VIOLATION OF THE STACK RULES WE ESTABLISHED AFTER THE DISASTER THAT WAS JENKIN'S MISTBIND CLIQUE DECK!" At another table, someone - probably Jenkins - shouts back, "YOU JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITY AND JOY OF LOCKING ANOTHER PLAYER OUT OF THEIR TURN, BUDDY!" The chaos is completely overwhelming and while you recognize the words they are saying, the meaning is completely incomprehensible to you. Your escort rings a bell at the bottom of the hall, and the common room goes silent as everyone turns towards you. Buddy stands up and addresses the room, "Fellow gamers, we have a newbie among us. Who would challenge this one to a rite of passage?" Every hand in the room raises immediately. Buddy smiles and says, "It's a dice-off! {player}, we're going to need a lot of dice."

quest:"Secretly A Society Summons You XI",
info:`A dice-off among this secret society is, as you soon find out, a game of dice involving two players rolling two dice each to get closest to seven with the smallest gap between the two numbers rolled. Ties require a re-roll. In this particular format, each matchup is won by getting two wins out of three total rolls. In this very particular instance, Buddy distributed six dice to every member of the society and then two dice to you. He then instructed all of the society members to roll their three turns onto the table in front of them, separated neatly and clearly for you to come roll against. If there are any ties, the member is expected to re-roll with you until the tie is broken. “Your mission”, Buddy says, “is to defeat two thirds of the members of this society. Do that, and you’re in. Fail to do it, and you won’t be able to join the SGSR.” Oh good, a statistically improbable situation. Despite the odds set against you, you approach each table, roll three times with each member of the society, re-roll ties, and then document whether you won or lost on a scorecard Buddy made for you. After all of your matchups, you find, and Buddy verifies, that you won three matches short of half of the total matches. Nowhere near two thirds. “It’s ok.” Buddy says. “I don’t think anyone has won two thirds on their first try. The good news is you can keep trying. The bad news is you can’t join the SGSR. The really great news is you are welcome to attend our monthly potluck dinner tomorrow evening, if you’d like.” Buddy Friendship 50`,

This time, Jenkins greets you at the entryway with a quizzical expression, but motions you onward to the common area. As you enter the common area, you see a long stretch of tables connected together and covered with such a variety and quantity of food that you’re sure no crowd this size could ever eat it all. You place your potluck contributions on the table and then you and your box go and find a seat at one of the other tables spread around the great hall. Before you have a chance to start looking around the hall, Buddy is in the seat next to you wondering why you brought your membership box. “You’re not giving up, are you?” You assure Buddy that you’re not giving up. Instead, you assumed the society would want their items back until you pass the dice-off test. “But you just passed the real test!” Buddy interjects. “You didn’t give up! I said you couldn’t join the SGSR, but that’s not us. We’re actually the Gaming And More - Enigmatic Redbrook Society, or GAMERS for short. The test to join GAMERS was just to enjoy gaming and be a good sport about it. I’d say you definitely passed that entry requirement, friend.” To make it official, Buddy jumps up in his chair and announces you as the newest member of the Gaming And More - Enigmatic Redbrook Society. After a round of applause, various cheers and hoots, and a booming “HURRAY!” from Buddy, Buddy invites everyone to eat. As the other society members begin to browse the food and fill their plates, Buddy hops off his chair and congratulates you. He then pulls a pair of dice from his pocket and presents them to you. “Keep these secret and safe. They will allow you to enter the society’s underground headquarters, along with a few other secret locations around Redbrook. You should come play cards at the secret card house!” Not for the first time, or the last, you wonder if Buddy is this clever on purpose or if he just stumbles into these things.

    info:`The machine whirs and hums, brought to life again and you both hop on, there’s just enough room if you shed the non essential items from your packs. The trail you both left on your first trip up the phenomenon is crystal clear in the snow and ice. Knowing what to expect, you push forward faster than you did originally, the snow and wind pick up as you approach the Wall. You both agree to leave the machine outside the Wall and step off, buffeted by the wind and snow, Thomas steps forward, you see the plain case in one hand and he motions to you with the other. “STAY CLOSE!” The wind is deafening at this point. Thomas kneels to the ground and sets the box on the snow. He grabs your hand and opens the box. Immediately, the shockwave erupts from the box, but mysteriously, you are unaffected. The unnatural sensations of the sound of the ocean, the roar of the wind, the frigidness of snow, the steam heat of boiled water are present, but encapsulate you both in an aura of comfort, instead of pushing you away. You feel a serenity in the midst of this otherworldly sensation. Thomas looks at you, wide eyed. “Here goes nothing.” He picks up the dagger and you see a glow emit from his eyes. His voice grows deeper, more resonant. It’s Thomas, but there is something more there. “Take the box, the wizard would not appreciate losing it.” he states matter-of-factly. There is an edge to his words and you look to him unsure how to hold onto his hand and pick up the box with the other. Releasing your hand, Thomas’s voice is even less natural than before. “Have no fear, I shall keep you safe.” You put the box in your bag and step forward with Thomas. The Wall looms before you, and as you near it, there is an intensity you can’t quite put your finger on, but the aura extends forward and the Wall parts as you move closer. You move forward slowly, until you are completely surrounded by the wall. A storm rages around you, but the dagger, or Thomas, or both, keep you safe from the raging forces around you. All around, a deep scream echoes. Pain and weariness intermixed with bitter rage. You shut your eyes and put your hands over your ears to stop the assault on your senses until Thomas puts a hand on your shoulder, and the screams subside. You both press on, there is an odd gleam in Thomas’ eyes, somewhere between determination you get the sense that he is having fun. `,

    info:`Suddenly, as quickly as the wall began, you see clear skies pierce the horrors of the Wall around you. The Wall recedes as you move forward together and the pressure and noise surrounding you ceases immediately. What you see before you is unlike any majesty you’ve ever witnessed. Sun glistens off patches of ice, vibrant green grass grows in between patches of pristine white snow. A tree blossoms in a small frozen pond, purple and red hues accenting the light green leaves leaving you dazzled. Moments later, you realize water is continually falling from various branches, as though a fountain. Far away, a wall of ice seems to climb higher and higher out of the ground and water falls from its peak into a waterfall, glistening in the sun. The sound of the massive waterfall is at once tumultuous and calming. The water falls into a lake that you now see is the centerpiece of this area. The lake is surrounded by ice and a massive ice formation with one small stream running east towards the ocean. After a moment of appreciating the splendor surrounded by Shva’s Wall, you gather yourself and offer the plain box to Thomas, but he looks at it suspiciously. “Perhaps I should keep the dagger…close.” He clenches the dagger tightly in one hand and steps towards the lake. “I’m being called. What you are seeing, is…my home.” Thomas winces at these words and without another word, he begins to move towards the lake. Calling out, Thomas completely ignores you as he takes step after step forward. Reaching the lake, he steps onto it and ice spreads out beneath his feet. He looks back to you, expectantly, but as you gingerly step on a shallow pool of water your foot plunges directly through. “Ah yes. Hm. You’re going to need a boat. Or well, an approximation of one.” `,

The boats gently rise up into the air and drift towards the lake, and the rings disappear, strangely. You blink, and before you is a small boat fashioned out of ice. “It’s entirely safe, let’s be off.” The being known as Thomas smiles with satisfaction, and you feel a breeze in the air and a sound like a gentle sigh crosses your ears. Thomas grasps the side of your ice boat and you begin to travel inward. The lake seems limitless. Fish flit in mesmerizing chaotic patterns, the sun cascades off the fish and the ripples of the lake, highlighting the brilliant oddity of the situation. All around you, a chaotic wall of rage and raw elemental energy swirls, but in this moment, you feel calm. The northernmost part of the lake is where the ice grows highest, and Thomas propels himself and your boat towards it. The majesty of the moment strikes you, and you lose all sense of time taking in your surroundings. As you approach, you realize there is a small landing, and a doorway in a shaded alcove. The closer you get, the more it seems something is very wrong. The alcove has a large gash, and the doorway is agape - a large door of ice lays on the entryway. The quiet calm gives way to a sense of unease. “You’ll need a torch.” The echo of Thomas says. Looking at your companion, he seems faded, as though his energy is being withered away, even faster than before you began your journey. `,

He is unresponsive at first but after a moment he looks at you with a lopsided smile. “Was…it all a dream? I was me, but I was more. Or, I was someone or maybe something else?” He pauses momentarily, “Either way, it was so cool! I wish I could remember more.” he seems lost in thought, and you notice Thomas winces again as he uses his arms to stand up off the ground. For a brief moment, you swear you could see his hand disappear entirely. A gentle snow falls in the room, the single opening in the chamber illuminates the Tomb of Zho, Guardian of Water, and for a moment, you close your eyes, the enormity of the moment giving you pause. You motion quietly to Thomas, not ready to disturb the serenity of the tomb. You both step outside the cavern and quickly realize that Zho’s Wall is gone, but the majesty of Zho’s Playground remains. “Oh man, Glacier Lake is so cool! Let’s go fishing!” Thomas exclaims. You both laugh, and Thomas seems to be back to his old (new?) self, and after reflection you realize you might also like to take a moment to explore the lake. You both get into the ice boat and cast off, worries forgotten for the moment, the joy of discovery, fishing, and friendship are the only things you see on the horizon. `,

His horse has abandoned him, the ruins of his cabbage crop lay behind you, yet he stares towards Redbrook with a fierce gaze. “I will not be dissuaded!” he cries out to no one in particular. The dust and debris clear and Charles Horsington III steps out and steps in front of the now horseless cart. “Neigh.” Baba and Charles share a look together, and they set off to Redbrook. Bracing yourself for the worst, you try to keep a safe distance and listen for any distress but surprisingly, you hear no outcry in the distance. You reach the outskirts of Redbrook where some town guards are inspecting incoming goods. “...cabbage slugs?” “Yes sir, it’s a very serious infestation from south of the Sinking Swamps in Tirfindoir. I’m going to need to check your cabbages.” It’s at this moment you notice a cloaked figure slinking away from Baba’s cart. The guards begin inspecting Baba’s cart, and before you can blink, one of them shouts, “SLUG INFESTATION!” Several guards immediately throw oil and fire on Baba’s cart and set it alight while Baba cries out. “MY CABBAGES!!!!!!” `,

Baba is as cheerful and charming as the first day you met. He’s talking animatedly to Cecil about the various benefits of cabbages to digestive tracts, and their intensely vibrant additive flavor to bacon. “You are a surprisingly knowledgeable merchant of cabbage, my friend. I look forward to seeing your sales tactics in Redbrook!” Cecil and Baba greet you and without much pomp or circumstance, Cecil gathers the components and in a blinding golden flash, Cecil, Baba, and the crops have all disappeared. You go back to your daily farm duties. In the back of your mind, you can't help but continue to think about the strange partnership of Baba and Cecil. Slowly your curiosity continues to build until you can no longer wait any longer, and you head into the city to see what's become of the curious cabbage dealer. As you head towards Market Square you hear in the distance, “MY CABBAGES!!!” Luckily you came prepared. `,

If you have any ideas, let me know!” You think on it for a moment, and promise to suggest any ideas that come your way and head towards town. Baba excitedly unloads your cabbages and melons and begins arranging them around his cart. “Today promises to be the best day yet! Sales are through the roof. In fact, I really need a roof, at this point. I am hoping to promote my cabbage-only diet today. That’ll be sure to bring the customers in! And melons. Boy - so many ideas. Sure they’re just organic husks of flavored water, but think of the potential! Let’s do another round for tomorrow. Also let me pay it forward, could you bring me some more supplies to improve my selling cart space?” Baba has been honest with you so far, so you decide the pay is worth it and head back to gather what he needs. `,
