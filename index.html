                Q1 : I cant gain Exp in Mining / Crafting ... how to get more ?<br>
                <div class="thinline"></div>
                A1 : You click on ore (Mining) / bars (Crafting), to see the option for<br>
                converting item into Exp using Stardust<br>
                This option may be locked if you did not progress far enough to unlock skills<br>
                or do quests but it will pop soon enough ...
            </div>
            <div class="faq">
                Q2 : mining skill ... why bother leveling up ?
                <div class="thinline"></div>
                Things you craft like machinery that you use in mining tab<br>
                will have a level requirement to start using it.<br>
                also the chisel tool will randomly help you found Geodes IF<br>
                you have met the mining level(s) required.
            </div>
            <div class="faq">
                Q3 : Is Fishing or Finding seeds automatic?! Am I doing something wrong?<br>
                <div class="thinline"></div>
                A3 : (If you did unlock the skills)<br>  
                You fish and find seeds automatically. It's quite slow early game. For fishing, as you gain levels<br>
                and get more fishing tools this speeds up quite a lot. For finding seeds, its always quite slow but gathering<br>
                in the fields and upgrading your rake improves the seed rates substantially.<br>
            </div>

            <div class="faq">
                Q4 : Energy is so hard to get! How do I solve my energy problem???<br>
                <div class="thinline"></div>
                A4 : You don't. Energy is a persistent problem through the entire game. That being said, in gathering you unlock<br>
                Fruit Tree fertilizer. This is a substantial upgrade to your energy income and is critical in getting. Additionally<br>
                upgrading your oven, socketing your fishing tools (so they get more exp and in turn catch more fish) and running<br>
                the “Fields” combat zone are all great ways to help mitigate your energy problems. Fields has 3 mobs who drop energy<br>
                when fought and is a very cheap way to combat when energy is scarce.

            <div class="faq">
                Q5 : Any best order to upgrade tools ?<br>
                <div class="thinline"></div>
                A5 : tough question kinda player taste related ... <br>
                now we may consider not too bad of a choice : <br>
                - [Brewing Kit] and [Axe]<br>

                Basics :<br>

                Idle Pixel runs on a tick system.<br>
                You'll learn the rhythm of it the more you play.<br><br>
                There are 2 major portions to combat :<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your gear and stats</li>
                    <li>Your spells</li>
                </ul>
                The game starts very basically then grows more complex.<br>
                Until the “Volcano” combat area, the combat is very simple.<br>
                No micro-management or strategy used outside of “click & heal”.<br>
                (!)Kindly not pay too much attention to sets of bow-arrows-shield at once<br>
                Additionally in this game there are 3 types of mobs :<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Common Mobs</li>
                    <li>[R]are mobs (~20% chance)</li>
                    <li>Shiny mobs (not available until a specific quest, chance to meet 1%)</li>
                </ul><br>
                Once EASY combat achievement is completed, every 10lv of combined melee/range<br>
                will add some permanent 1HP Max upgrade, and magic will do the same to mana.<br><br>
                The effective (but boring) "magic level training" is this :<br>
                sit in the FIELDS with a bow and **no-arrow** to be able to use the highest spells<br>
                availables as many times as possible before fight ends.<br>
                (Game wont let you enter a fight with no-arrow but you may build a preset without<br>
                OR exit fight to take off arrows)<br><br>
                Starting from Volcano, the dumb "hit-and-heal" combat process will switch to<br>
                using combat presets and try to fit the best action with best timing ...<br><br>
                Presets are Button binded equippement selections you made and saved.<br>
                Up to 5 presets available.<br>
                During a fight pressing a button will thus swap to desired preset<br><br>

                    - Are able to wear a FULL bear armor : If monster wont kill you, cold will<br>
                    - Have a large stash of fire arrows (around/over 200 is a fair start)<br>
                    - if Possible crafted some Rings (chisel & Geodes content)<br><br>

                                    The Yeti has a freezing attack. He shakes, then freezes you for about… 6 seconds (~2 attacks)<br>
                                    This attack can be reflected OR also broken by a fire spell.<br><br>
                                    So the fight starts, you DON'T cast any spells. When he shakes, reflect the very 1st freeze.<br>
                                    Still don't cast any spells. From now on when he is able to freeze you, just break out with fire<br>
                                    Having the long bow and possibly accuracy ring(+2?) equipped will also make the fight easier.

                    <div class="thinline"></div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                        - You come to Mansion after obviously getting everything from NF<br>
                        - Coming here you should be around 32hp and at 19 mana<br>
                        - There's no gimmick here unlike in past games where you needed ghost scan<br>
                        - I wouldn't start doing Mansion without all T1 and T2 rings, I'd even wait<br>
                            for full T3 Damage and Defense<br>
                        - Additionally you need to have Spiked Club, Longbow isn't necessary at all<br>
                        - The last thing you need before you start is a Ghost Jar<br>
                        this is to unlock the invisibility spell which is required for the Reaper<br>
                        and makes the Exorcist far easier<br>
                        - the Mansion adds an Item Store after your first win<br>
                        currency used is the Ghost Essence (GE) which can be earned<br>
                        at the rate of : 1 fight => random 100 ~ 300 GE<br>
                        - Strongly recommended to buy the Scythe as soon as possible<br><br>
                        - this area will bring another Spell : Invisibility<br>
                          by beating a ghost AND owning a ghost jar you will trap the ghost inside<br>
                          the spell is then unlocked/crafted using 666 GE<br>
                          ** This spell will give you roughly 2 seconds of being completely untargetable.<br>
                          The spell has a 30 second cooldown and costs 2 mana. This opens up a less grueling<br>
                          magic EXP grind where you can cast both Invisibility and Reflect for faster combats!<br>
                          (NOTE : its still more exp/fight to use only reflect but using invisibility makes the<br>
                          fights 3x faster and less insanity causing)<br><br>
                        - also a spell upgrade for Healing spell here ... same exp earned or mana invested<br>
                        but healing effect is tripled !<br>

                                <li>Ghost  :<br>
                                    His fight is relatively simple. Its a tank and spank,<br>
                                    he occasionally goes invisible and thus unhittable through out the fight.<br>
                                    Use fire and reflect on cooldown while he's visible.<br>
                                    Naked reflect for more consistent damage. Pray.
                                </li><br>
                                <li>Grandma :<br>
                                    Grandma is a deceptively hard fight. If you look at her stats, she seems<br>
                                    to have low damage, low hp and low defense. The caveat is that every 3/4 ticks<br>
                                    (I'm not entirely sure), she heals for 3 hp. So it's also a DPS race. You kinda<br>
                                    just hope to hit big club rolls, spam fire and naked reflect. You can also heal<br>
                                    if you feel you have the spare mana.
                                </li><br>
                                <li>Exorcist :<br>
                                    Exorcist doesn't have standard auto attacks. Instead she attacks you with 100% accuracy,<br>
                                    50+ damage attacks. This fight is a severe DPS race. Reflect her first attack, dodge the<br>
                                    second using invisibility and spam fire on cooldown. If shes not dead by time the third<br>
                                    attack comes, you lose. I believe you can make 3 club swings in this fight.<br>
                                    If you want, you can opt into using the bow for faster attacks to be "safe".
                                </li><br>
                                <li>Reaper :<br>
                                    The Reaper is a rough but simple fight. When his eyes glow red, you have to mitigate<br>
                                    the next attack. Reflect > Invisibility for this. The reflect bounces back the damage<br>
                                    and is more valuable, you'll have to use both. When using the invisibility to dodge,<br>
                                    you must count to 2 before clicking it. Otherwise you'll invisibility too early and not dodge.<br>
                                    During the whole fight you must spam improved heal on cooldown if you aren't at max.
