                Q1 : I'm stuck in crafting! Nothing left to craft and I'm not level 10!<br>
                <div class="thinline"></div>
                A1 : You click on bars, converting stardust you get from brewing along with bars into EXP.<br>
                This is your main form of EXP for crafting.<br>
            </div>
            <div class="faq">
                Q2 : I have drills running, why am I not getting mining exp?! + What do mining levels do?!<br>
                <div class="thinline"></div>
                A2 : Mining exp is gained by turning ore + stardust into EXP the same way you do in crafting.<br>
                By clicking ore and hitting ‚Äúconvert to xp‚Äù. This is the main way to get mining exp.<br><br>
                **What do mining levels do?**<br>
                They unlock the ability to use higher tier machines (when you craft them). Additionally once you gather<br>
                the tool ‚ÄúChisel‚Äù your levels allow you to find higher tier geodes (Which are used for combat upgrades).<br><br>
            </div>
            <div class="faq">
                Q3 : Is Fishing or Finding seeds automatic?! Am I doing something wrong?<br>
                <div class="thinline"></div>
                A3 : You fish and find seeds automatically. It's quite slow early game. For fishing, as you gain levels<br>
                and get more fishing tools this speeds up quite a lot. For finding seeds, its always quite slow but gathering<br>
                in the fields and upgrading your rake improves the seed rates substantially.

            <div class="faq">
                Q4 : Energy is so hard to get! How do I solve my energy problem???<br>
                <div class="thinline"></div>
                A4 : You don't. Energy is a persistent problem through the entire game. That being said, in gathering you unlock<br>
                Fruit Tree fertilizer. This is a substantial upgrade to your energy income and is critical in getting. Additionally<br>
                upgrading your oven, socketing your fishing tools (so they get more exp and in turn catch more fish) and running<br>
                the ‚ÄúFields‚Äù combat zone are all great ways to help mitigate your energy problems. Fields has 3 mobs who drop energy<br>
                when fought and is a very cheap way to combat when energy is scarce.

                Q5 : How do I unlock Woodcutting!!!!!!!!!?<br>
                <div class="thinline"></div>
                A5 : You beat the Ent in the Ent boss quest. How do you beat the boss? Well that's a GREAT way to transition into‚Ä¶<br>

        __________________________________________________
        FOREST : Get comfortable for this zone. You'll be spending the slog-like early game here chasing quests and upgrades. This zone drops the oh so coveted seeds! It's a pretty decent place to spend time. Once again, due to this still being so early game. Your strategy for the fights is : click heal on cooldown if it heals you and pray.
        IMPORTANT NOTE : There is an achievement to beat the Ent (a rare mob) with only the bow. I highly suggest starting every fight with the bow and arrows equipped. IF the fight is not the Ent, then swap to your melee weapon to preserve ammo. You can swap by clicking the ‚Äúback‚Äù button at the top left and then re-enter by clicking ‚Äúfight‚Äù. Once you've beat it only using the bow you can lead your fights with a melee weapon once again.
        
        This zone has 3 common mobs.
        
        Snake - 1 major drop! Poison!
        1 - Poison is required for the ‚ÄúTank Boss‚Äù quest and upgrades the stinger into a poisoned stinger. A poisoned stinger attacks like normal, but 1/3 attacks (Doesn't matter if they land or do damage) will deal 1 bonus damage to your target. This item is relatively common at around 1/4. So don't feel despair if you run a little unlucky on it. Forest is a great zone to farm in.
        
        Ants - 1 major drop. Ant Needles.
        1 - Ant needles are a crafting component to make 2 different items. The Needle, a tool to break down spare armour into the base crafting component and the Spiked Club, the strongest melee weapon in the game (as of right now). The club is a long ways off, so make a needle and hold onto the rest of these until later.
        
        Wolf - 1 major drop, it's meat, yum!
        1 - Wolf meat is an energy refund if you can cook it! Cooking it successfully is required for an easy cooking achievement.
        
        It's also a great way to try for the other cooking achievement where you cook food without having the required level for it.
        
        This zone has 2 rare mobs.
        
        Thief - 1 major drop, a dagger~
        
        But more importantly you need to kill 3 thieves for the Thief Leader quest!
        1 - The dagger is effectively the same as the poisoned stinger in most fights. Its 0 accuracy, 2 damage and fast! Although it's 2 attack, it being fast makes it do very good damage. If you get one, use it, if not don't worry about it.
        
        Ent - 2 major drops. Their drops are Strange Leaves and Strange Leaf fertiliser.
        
        Additionally it drops tree seeds rather than leaf seeds.
        1 - Strange Leaves are a brewing material mainly for rare monster potions!
        2 - Strange Leaf fertilizer allows you to get strange leaves from cutting down trees in woodcutting. This is a must get! Likely this is what you'll be staying in forest for if you don't have it after beating Thief Boss.
        
        Don't leave this zone until you have gotten Strange Leaf fertilizer and beaten the Thief Boss! Once you've done that you can move onto caves.
        __________________________________________________
        TANK BOSS : Tank boss is really simple. Use a poisoned stinger and roll enough poison hits to win. That's all. Bosses don't take energy to fight, so losing isn't too big an issue.
        
        __________________________________________________
        THIEF LEADER : This isn't /technically/ a boss but I'll write a bit for it anyway. Their stats are same as a regular thief but with 12hp rather than 10. No real strategy here. They replace regular thief fights until beaten once. They then retreat to the Friendly Forest in gathering where you finish the quest
        __________________________________________________
        
        Caves: This zone is great for crafting exp, it's great for bones, great for rare drops! It's the first zone however to have a gimmick. Darkness. Fighting in the dark gives you an accuracy negative. That being said, a mob from this zone gives you a way to mitigate the darkness. There is still effectively no strategy to be had, use the dagger and heal when it's effective to. Alternatively you can use the poison stinger as its poison damage doesn't rely on hitting! It's a toss up for you to decide, both were effective enough in my playing.
        
        There are 3 common mobs in this zone.
        
        Goblin - 2 major drops.
        The lantern and the mask.
        1 - The Lantern is an off-hand slot ‚Äúweapon‚Äù that lights the area, removing the accuracy penalty from the caves.2 - The Mask is a cosmetic helmet you need to wear in order to start the Goblin Dad quest.* After starting the Goblin Dad quest, you need to kill 1-2 more goblins for their toenails, you'll need 10 or more to complete the quest.
        
        Finishing the quest unlocks Gem Goblins which are a 1/800 encounter rate. They are a free win, lots of exp and can drop 0-4 of the gems. So you could get sapphires, emeralds, rubies and diamonds all from one kill!
        
        Just make sure to wear full bear armour when you kill them so you don't die from the cold damage if you're in Northern Fields.
        
        Bear - 1 Major drop. Just like the lizard, they drop armour. Bear fur!
        
        1 - Bear fur is crafted into bear armour, Bear armour is used to counter the gimmick of the Northern Fields combat zone. Additionally with an emerald needle can be recycled and recrafted for a ton of crafting exp! However, unlike the lizard you can craft this armour somewhat freely as its inconsequential for a very long time.
        
        Bat - 1 Major Drop. Just like the bear and lizard, they drop armour. Bat skin.
        1 : Bat skin is the best armour in the game until we get promethium and titanium moulds for metal armours. Its +1 defence per piece compared to lizard armour for a total of +4 defence with the whole set.
        
        Just like bear fur and lizard skin, it's great to craft and recycle for crafting exp!
        
        Just like lizard skin as well, you want to be smart with crafting armour pieces to minimise the time it takes for you to get a full set.
        
        There is 1 rare mob in this zone.
        Skeleton - 5 major drops. Sword, Shield, Cart, Skull and Amulet.
        Some additional details, as the skeleton is the only rare mob in this zone. Rare potions are incredibly effective here, providing a very excellent way to get bones of which the skeleton drops 5-10x more compared to regular mobs.
        
        1 - Skeleton Sword. The Skeleton Sword is the premiere Melee weapon for a very long time. Its 1 accuracy, 5 damage and a normal speed. It requires 20 melee to equip.
        2 - Shield. The shield adds 4 defences! That's the same bonus as upgrading from lizard to bat! However, do not use the shield in the caves as you'll consequently regain the accuracy penalty.
        
        3 - Cart. The cart is used to unlock the next 3 combat zones. Volcano, Northern Field and Haunted Mansion. Click past caves in the ‚Äúfight‚Äù screen and talk to the miner to do this.
        
        4 - Skull. The skull is useless for a long time but very important to get! With 36 crafting and completing Doric's second quest (in the volcano combat zone) you can craft Glass orbs. These glass orbs can be enchanted to unlock shines in the game. Shines are a 1/100 occurrence that gives a 5-10x loot boost! To unlock shiny combat mobs you need the skull and 25 magic.
        
        5- Bone Amulet. Bone Amulet doubles the drops of regular bones when equipped. Bonemeal and thus bones are very valuable, this is an incredible upgrade!
        
        **Stay in caves until you've gotten Sword, Shield, full Bat armour, the Cart and have completed the Goblin Dad quest. I also suggest farming out the bone amulet as you'll spend your down time in the fields, and doubling your bones doing that is very important.**
        __________________________________________________
        Before you move onto Volcano, set about completing your Easy Combat Achievements and earning the perk. This will give you bonus HP and mana. Both of which are going to be important in the upcoming fights.
        Now that combat levels matter, I'll detail how they work and how the perk works. The perk gives you +1 hp for every 10 levels of Melee and Ranged combined you have. So if you have 14 melee and 6 ranged, that's +2 max hp. You gain melee and ranged exp based on the damage you deal using either weapon type. Mana is a very important stat in the game, spells are incredibly powerful and being able to cast more is awesome!
        
        So how do you level Magic? You level magic based on 2 things : How many spells you've cast in a combat, and what spells you've cast. Higher level spells give more Magic exp. The optimal way to level magic is by sitting in the Fields combat area. Wearing full armour, a bow with no arrows and a shield. You then cast reflect (a spell we'll be getting and going over in the Volcano area) until you run out of mana or they die. This is roughly 100 magic exp a minute but pretty tedious and boring.
        __________________________________________________
        
        Volcano : Volcano is the place where we get our next two spells and combat presets. It's also where mobs start having complexity as a result and strategy starts becoming important. There's a specific order you want to encounter mobs when starting Volcano, I'll write the guide in that order.
        Additionally mobs will drop 1 molten glass (after starting the Shiny Resources quest) and 1 lava (if you win the fight with a spare bucket crafted).There's 3 common mobs.
        
        Fire Snake : 1 major drop, fire!
        Strategy - Until you get reflect and fire. You just have to hope for good luck on your attacks and its fire attack. Once you get those spells unlocked. You reflect his fire attacks and use fire on cooldown.
        You can tell he's casting ‚Äúfire‚Äù when he glows red.
        1- The fire snake drops our second spell! Fire is a 3 mana, 5 second cooldown spell that does 0-5 damage. It requires holding the magic staff though.
        Almost always, its worth using this spell over ‚Äúheal‚Äù. Dealing damage is usually better than healing 1hp.
        Once you get this spell unlocked, move back to the fields zone and cast it 5 times in order to unlock ‚Äúcombat presets‚Äù
        
        ______
        **Presets!**
        So now you've unlocked combat presets. Combat presets are great! For each zone from here on I'll detail the required presets.
        What ARE presets anyway? You bind a set of gear to your 1/2/3/4/5 keys. Allowing you to swap from melee to ranged, to magic and back with a click of a button. With practice you'll learn the rhythm of when you can swap very quickly to magic to cast, then back to your ranged/melee set. Until then I suggest waiting until you attack. Then swap, cast, then swap back.
        I like my sets as follows.
        1 - Melee 2 - Magic 3 - Ranged 4 - Poisons Stinger (For Volcano exclusively)
        Melee is most of your combat, so having it on 1 makes sense. You cast every fight and need to swap quickly to magic and then back to melee, so magic on 2 also makes sense. Ranged on 3 is just in case I have use for it.
        
        ________
        Fire Golem : 1 Major drop. A BOMB.
        Strategy - Cast fire as soon as possible, then cast it as soon as it comes off cooldown two more times. Anymore than that will result in blowing yourself up, instantly losing the fight. After casting fire, you just kinda hope to hit and kill him, If he drops to 1hp, you can swap to a poison stinger since your standard hit rate on him is 33% and you could still hit a 0. Poison stinger will have a flat 33% to do 1 damage and is a safer chance. In addition to having 1 major drop, you must lose to the fire golem once but casting ‚Äúfire‚Äù when he pulls out his bomb in order to unlock Doricks quest ‚ÄúShiny Resources‚Äù.
        IMPORTANT NOTE - When completing ‚ÄúShiny Resources‚Äù you'll be given a choice of rewards between Food, Wood, Potions and Money. There is an absolutely clear winner, its potions.
        Potions as a reward will roll 0-4 on ‚ÄúSuper Stardust Potion‚Äù, ‚ÄúSmithing Upgrade Potion‚Äù, ‚ÄúRare Monster Potion‚Äù, ‚ÄúHeat Potion‚Äù and ‚ÄúSuper Rare Monster Potion‚Äù. The value of this reward is many many times stronger than the other.
        
        1 - Bomb is a great reward! This fight is pretty frustrating and RNG but the bomb makes it worth it.The bomb drops All the ores. Stone -> Promethium. It also gives you at least 1 promethium bar. Additionally it gives 5k mining exp.
        
        Fire Hawk - 1 Major drop. Fire Feathers.
        Strategy - Nothing special, just hit him. Use fire on cooldown. The fire hawk isn't required for any quests, but is absolutely the mob you want to fight as often as possible to gather its drop as much as possible.
        1 - Fire arrows are made from fire feathers in batches of 15. Fire arrows compared to regular arrows can do 3 more damage a shot. For a total of 5. More importantly, in our next combat zone all fire damage deals double. Meaning that fire arrows actually can hit for 10, rather than 5. They're required in enormous bulk to progress there.
        
        There is 1 rare mob in this zone.
        
        Fire Witch : 3 major drops. Fire Crystal, Health Crystal and reflect.
        Strategy - Use fire to whittle her down. Make sure to save 1 mana. When she gets to 1 hp, she'll shake. When this happens, cast reflect.
        The first time you encounter the witch, you WILL lose. To gain reflect you have to die to her 1hp enrage mechanic and have the mirror + an emerald hammer/pickaxe. However once you get reflect she becomes the easiest fight in the zone. I suggest using her to level your ranged skill.
        1 - Fire Crystal is 1 of 4 crystals you're looking to gather for story progression! This is a guaranteed drop.
        2 - The health crystal gives you +5 hp, making you significantly stronger.
        3 - Reflect is a very powerful spell. It costs 1 mana and has a 30 second cooldown. Its effect is that it will reflect the next incoming attack or ability back to your foe. This does NOT work on the Fire Golem in Volcano. It does however work on effectively every other ability, it is also the best way to level magic.
        
        Northern Fields is a lot harder than Volcano. Additionally you'll need to gather 60 molten glass from Volcano and I'd suggest no less than 200 fire arrows. Stay in Volcano until you've got the required glass, gotten the health crystal and a large stack of fire arrows.
        __________________________________________________
        Northern Fields : NF requires a lot of preparation and being patient when you go to it. Around this point in the game, you should have 50+ gathering unlocked.
        Northern Fields has a gimmick, cold environment! You must wear bear fur armour you'll freeze to death, this also applies if you happen to find a gem goblin here. This makes it possible to die to the gem goblin! If you manage to do that, you'll surely leave a great legacy of disappointment.
        Your priority is getting the chisel. It provided combat upgrades which boost your damage, accuracy and defence. For NF, all your damage is effectively doubled. Furthermore the weapon we'll be using for the most part, the short bow will not have 100% accuracy without a +2 accuracy ring. Waiting for ring upgrades will massively increase your win rate.
        In addition the Carpenter quest should be available as well. This quest is expensive, but its reward is of the utmost importance for fighting in the Northern Fields. It costs 100 pine logs, 10 promethium bars, 10 strange leaves, 10 lava, 20 molten glass, 200 gold bars and 100k stone. As a reward, whenever you win a fight in NF, you gain 33% of your energy back. So each win costs you less than 3k energy which is your main gate to this zone.
        There are additionally some stat thresholds I suggest for a smooth ride. I'd suggest only going to NF when you've reached 25+ hp and 14 mana.For all the mobs other than the rare, 13 mana is fine enough, but with the rare being the most important to kill. Having 2 reflects available (14 mana) is quite important.
        
        **NF Presets :** 1 - Shortbow (later replaced with Longbow). Fire arrows. Shield. Full bear armour. 2 - Staff. Shield. Full bear armour. 3 - Shortbow. Fire arrows. NO shield Full bear armour.4 - Sword (Later replaced with Spiked Club). Shield. Full bear armour. All your fights are done with your bow, casting magic to support.
        
        There are 3 common mobs.
        
        Ice Hawk : 1 major drop, ice feathers!
        Strategy - The Hawk is a standard DPS race with 1 important note. The Hawk will occasionally shutter and shake, when it does this use reflect. This does a lot of damage to him, making the fight pretty easy. The rest of the time use fire as you please.
        
        1 - Ice arrows are made from ice feathers! They are 7 base damage and very powerful! If you really really really hate the fire golem in Volcano, these are perfect for him.
        
        Ice Golem : 2 major drops! Longbow frame and arrows.
        Strategy - We have created preset #3 specifically for the Ice Golem. He's the most simple mob in NF and is strictly a DPS race.
        You spam fire on cooldown, then you do what we call a ‚Äúnaked reflect‚Äù where you swap to preset 3 and use reflect. By unequipping your shield, you guarantee he is able to attack you. This increases the chance you have a successful reflect.
        
        1 - The Longbow frame is able to be made into a longbow with 40 crafting and 50 string. The longbow is a 0 damage, 3 accuracy, standard speed bow. If you don't have a +2 accuracy ring then this is a major upgrade. If you do have the +2 accuracy ring, then this upgrade doesn't change your chances in NF.
        2 - Arrows! On kill he can drop a whole ton of arrows. Regular arrows, fire arrows and ice arrows! It's a great refund and a great stockpiling for ranged combat.
        
        Ice Witch : 2 major drops~ Health crystal and mana crystal.Strategy : Cast fire twice, reflect when she shakes at 1hp. Cast fire 2 more times. Let Smitty take the wheel and pray.
        
        1 - Health crystal. It's +5hp! That's very good and makes the fights even easier.
        2 - Mana crystal. It's +5 mana! This is an even more powerful upgrade than HP! This will allow you to weave in a heal into fights on top of another fire.
        There's 1 rare mob in this zone
        
        Yeti : 2 major drops. The club and the ice crystal.
        Strategy - The Yeti has a freezing attack. He shakes, then freezes you for about‚Ä¶ 6 seconds. 2 attacks or so. This attack can be reflecting and also broken with fire.So the fight starts, you DON'T cast any spells. When he shakes, reflect the first one. Still don't cast any spells. Whenever he freezes you and you can't reflect it, then you use your fire to break out. Pretty easy.
        I suggested having 14 mana before coming to NF so that you can reflect 2 freezes and cast fire 4 times. With 14 mana and longbow (or the +2 accuracy ring) I think Yeti is a very comfortable and easy fight.
        1 - Club. The club is cool, but not its full potential. It upgrades with 100 ant spikes into the Spiked Club! The spiked club has 12 damage, 3 accuracy and is a slow weapon. Its the most powerful non-elemental attack we'll likely see for a while. Also by virtue of being melee, it has no upkeep cost.
        2 - The ice crystal is the 4th and final crystal we need to collect for the story! Grind for it and complete that quest!
