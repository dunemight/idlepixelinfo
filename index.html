            <div class="faq">
                Q1 : I'm stuck in crafting! Nothing left to craft and I'm not level 10!<br>
                <div class="thinline"></div>
                A1 : You click on bars, converting stardust you get from brewing along with bars into EXP.<br>
                This is your main form of EXP for crafting.<br>
            </div>
            <div class="faq">
                Q2 : I have drills running, why am I not getting mining exp?! + What do mining levels do?!<br>
                <div class="thinline"></div>
                A2 : Mining exp is gained by turning ore + stardust into EXP the same way you do in crafting.<br>
                By clicking ore and hitting “convert to xp”. This is the main way to get mining exp.<br><br>
                **What do mining levels do?**<br>
                They unlock the ability to use higher tier machines (when you craft them). Additionally once you gather<br>
                the tool “Chisel” your levels allow you to find higher tier geodes (Which are used for combat upgrades).<br><br>
            </div>
            <div class="faq">
                Q3 : Is Fishing or Finding seeds automatic?! Am I doing something wrong?<br>
                <div class="thinline"></div>
                A3 : You fish and find seeds automatically. It's quite slow early game. For fishing, as you gain levels<br>
                and get more fishing tools this speeds up quite a lot. For finding seeds, its always quite slow but gathering<br>
                in the fields and upgrading your rake improves the seed rates substantially.
            </div>

            <div class="faq">
                Q4 : Energy is so hard to get! How do I solve my energy problem???<br>
                <div class="thinline"></div>
                A4 : You don't. Energy is a persistent problem through the entire game. That being said, in gathering you unlock<br>
                Fruit Tree fertilizer. This is a substantial upgrade to your energy income and is critical in getting. Additionally<br>
                upgrading your oven, socketing your fishing tools (so they get more exp and in turn catch more fish) and running<br>
                the “Fields” combat zone are all great ways to help mitigate your energy problems. Fields has 3 mobs who drop energy<br>
                when fought and is a very cheap way to combat when energy is scarce.

                Q5 : How do I unlock Woodcutting!!!!!!!!!?<br>

                Basics :<br> 
                <div class="thinline"></div>
                Idle Pixel runs on a tick system.<br>
                You'll learn the rhythm of it the more you play.<br><br>
                There are 2 major portions to combat :<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your gear and stats</li>
                    <li>Your spells</li>
                </ul>
                The game starts very basically then grows more complex.<br>
                Until the “Volcano” combat area, the combat is very simple.<br>
                No micro-management or strategy used outside of “click & heal”.<br>
                (!)Kindly not pay too much attention to sets of bow-arrows-shield at once<br>
                Additionally in this game there are 3 types of mobs :<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Common Mobs</li>
                    <li>[R]are mobs (~20% chance)</li>
                    <li>Shiny mobs (not available until a specific quest, chance to meet 1%)</li>
                </ul><br>
                Once EASY combat achievement is completed, every 10lv of combined melee/range<br>
                will add some permanent 1HP Max upgrade, and magic will do the same to mana.<br><br>
                The effective (but boring) "magic level training" is this :<br>
                sit in the FIELDS with a bow and **no-arrow** to be able to use the highest spells<br>
                availables as many times as possible before fight ends.<br>
                (Game wont let you enter a fight with no-arrow but you may build a preset without<br>
                OR exit fight to take off arrows)<br><br>
                Starting from Volcano, the dumb "hit-and-heal" combat process will switch to<br>
                using combat presets and try to fit the best action with best timing ...<br><br>
                Presets are Button binded equippement selections you made and saved.<br>
                Up to 5 presets available.<br>
                During a fight pressing a button will thus swap to desired preset<br><br>

                                    The Yeti has a freezing attack. He shakes, then freezes you for about… 6 seconds (~2 attacks)<br>
                                    This attack can be reflected OR also broken by a fire spell.<br><br>
                                    So the fight starts, you DON'T cast any spells. When he shakes, reflect the very 1st freeze.<br>
                                    Still don't cast any spells. From now on when he is able to freeze you, just break out with fire<br>
                                    Having the long bow and possibly accuracy ring(+2?) equipped will also make the fight easier.

        <!---
        IMPORTANT NOTE - When completing “Shiny Resources” you'll be given a choice of rewards between Food, Wood, Potions and Money. There is an absolutely clear winner, its potions.
        Potions as a reward will roll 0-4 on “Super Stardust Potion”, “Smithing Upgrade Potion”, “Rare Monster Potion”, “Heat Potion” and “Super Rare Monster Potion”. 
        The value of this reward is many many times stronger than the other.
        
        Northern Fields : NF requires a lot of preparation and being patient when you go to it. Around this point in the game, you should have 50+ gathering unlocked.
        Northern Fields has a gimmick, cold environment! You must wear bear fur armour you'll freeze to death, 
        this also applies if you happen to find a gem goblin here. This makes it possible to die to the gem goblin! 
        If you manage to do that, you'll surely leave a great legacy of disappointment.
        Your priority is getting the chisel. It provided combat upgrades which boost your damage, accuracy and defence. 
        For NF, all your damage is effectively doubled. Furthermore the weapon we'll be using for the most part, 
        the short bow will not have 100% accuracy without a +2 accuracy ring. Waiting for ring upgrades will massively increase your win rate.
        In addition the Carpenter quest should be available as well. This quest is expensive, but its reward is of the utmost importance for fighting in the Northern Fields. 
        It costs 100 pine logs, 10 promethium bars, 10 strange leaves, 10 lava, 20 molten glass, 200 gold bars and 100k stone. 
        As a reward, whenever you win a fight in NF, you gain 33% of your energy back. So each win costs you less than 3k energy which is your main gate to this zone.
        There are additionally some stat thresholds I suggest for a smooth ride. 
        I'd suggest only going to NF when you've reached 25+ hp and 14 mana.For all the mobs other than the rare, 13 mana is fine enough, 
        but with the rare being the most important to kill. Having 2 reflects available (14 mana) is quite important.
